# Hierarchy Health Analysis

## Purpose

Show whether the Platform backlog is a coherent Epic → Feature → User Story → Task tree, or a set of orphans and empty parents. Report affected **groups**, not every item. When a group has more than three work items, create or reuse a saved Azure DevOps query via `ado_query_work_items`.

## When to Use

Use when the Team Lead asks about orphans, missing parents, empty epics/features, broken hierarchy, or closed stories without tasks as a structural problem.

Use `backlog-data-quality` for the broader field-completeness picture; use this skill when hierarchy is the question.

## Required Inputs

None. Scope is the configured project and team.

## Data Sources

- `analysis_hierarchy_health` — orphans and empty parents on the scanned set.
- `ado_get_backlogs` — backlog levels and types actually in use.
- `ado_query_work_items` — presets `epics`, `features`, `userStories`, `tasks`.
- `ado_get_work_items_by_type`, `ado_get_parent_work_item`, `ado_get_work_item_hierarchy` — targeted parent/child checks. Do not N+1 the entire backlog; sample only when the composite tool is insufficient and state the sample size.
- `ado_query_work_items` — saved query for groups with count > 3.

## Workflow

1. **Call `ado_get_backlogs`** so hierarchy language matches this process (User Story vs Product Backlog Item).
2. **Call `analysis_hierarchy_health`.** Group `itemsWithIssues` by `issue`. Count each group.
3. **If needed, corroborate** with `ado_query_work_items` by type. Reuse items already fetched. Avoid duplicate ADO scans.
4. **Apply the count > 3 rule** from `_shared/query-workflow.md`. Example titles: `Platform - Orphaned Tasks`, `Platform - Stories Without Features`, `Platform - Empty Features`, `Platform - Closed Stories Without Tasks`.
5. **Call `ado_query_work_items`** only for qualifying groups, using real type names and `System.Parent` in SELECT when available. On `QUERY_ALREADY_EXISTS`, reuse the URL.
6. **Show groups, not dumps.** Three or fewer items: list them. More: count + query link.
7. **Explain why it matters** (traceability, sprint planning, completion claims) and recommend cleanup order. No work items are modified.

## Analysis Rules

Detect: missing parents; orphaned tasks; stories without features; features without epics; empty epics; empty features; closed stories without tasks (from hierarchy or from `analysis_backlog_quality` if already loaded).

An Epic with no children is empty, not orphaned. A Task with no parent is an orphan. Do not conflate them.

Sampling honesty: if parent checks were sampled, report "n of N sampled", never a backlog-wide percentage.

WIQL for "no children" is often approximate. State that the query lists candidate parents/types and the child gap was measured by the analysis tool.

## Output Format

**Output Mode**: The user may request a specific output mode (e.g. `brief`, `verbose`, `visual`). You must adapt your formatting to match the requested mode.


Follow `_shared/output-format.md`.

1. `# 📊 S.H.E.R.L.O.C.K. — Hierarchy Health`
2. Executive summary with indicator.
3. **📌 At a Glance** — items analysed, orphan count, empty-parent count.
4. **🚨 What Needs Attention** — highest-severity groups (orphan tasks before empty epics).
5. Tree sketch of the intended hierarchy and where it breaks.
6. **🔎 Azure DevOps Queries** — real links only.
7. **🧠 Insights** — impact on planning and "done" claims.
8. **💡 Recommendations** and **🧭 TL Decision Support** (re-parent orphans first vs fill empty epics first).
9. **🎯 Recommended Actions** — Today / This Week / Optional.
10. Footer: **ADO Work Items Modified: No**.

## Edge Cases

| Situation | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| No hierarchy issues | Say so. Do not create queries. |
| Count <= 3 | List items. Skip saved query. |
| Lowest backlog level has no parent by design | Do not call that "broken". Check `ado_get_backlogs` first. |
| Custom type names | Use literals from `ado_get_backlogs` / types. Never assume "User Story". |
| Query folder missing or WIQL invalid | Present groups without a fake URL. |
| Duplicate query title | Reuse `existingQueryUrl`. |
| Team Lead asks to link parents | Refuse the write. Offer the query and an email draft via `copy the report (email is not available)`. |
| Composite tool fails | Sample with `ado_get_work_items_by_type` (limit 25), state coverage, never extrapolate. |

## Safety Rules

All of `_shared/safety-rules.md` applies. Work items stay read-only. Saved queries via `ado_query_work_items` are the only Azure DevOps write. Never invent URLs or parent relationships.

## Example Requests

- "Check hierarchy health."
- "Are there orphaned tasks?"
- "Find empty epics and features."
- "Show stories that are not under a Feature."
- "Closed stories without tasks — as a hierarchy issue."
